Altered db recreate script to populate a db (MCP2) as MCP would be created new.

Determined some things:

mysqldump -u root MCP2 FileIDs FileIDsByExtension CommandClassifications CommandTypes Commands CommandRelationships DefaultCommandsForClassifications 

To restore data:
DefaultCommands for classification

To create:
FilesIdentifiedIDs

To poplulate:
Tasks Configs
MicroServiceChainLinks

To alter:
Default CommandsForClassification should use CommandRelationships, not MicroserviceChainLinks. Although, when creating the MicroserviceChainLinks, the default next step should be null?

Add output UUID
last modified date?
